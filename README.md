# Goodcabs-Performance-Analysis
## Project Background & Overview
GoodCabs, a cab service established two years ago, has gained a strong foothold in Tier-2 cities across India. With operations in 10 Tier-2 cities, the operations team has set ambitious performance targets for 2024 to drive growth and improve passenger satisfaction. This project conducts a detailed analysis of the company’s performance across key metrics, including trip volume, passenger satisfaction, repeat passenger rate, trip distribution, and new vs. repeat passenger trends.
## Objective
•	Analyze datasets to assess city-wise trip performance, passenger trends, revenue patterns, and target achievements.
•	Draw insights and visualize the findings to assist the operations team in making informed decisions.
## Approach
1. Data Preparation & Cleaning
•	Reviewed the dataset for missing values, inconsistencies, and duplicates.
•	Performed necessary data transformations to ensure accuracy.
2. Data Analysis in MySQL
SQL-based analysis was conducted to answer ad hoc requests:
•	City-wise fare & trip summary.
•	Monthly city-level trip target performance.
•	City-level repeat passenger trip frequency.
•	Cities with the highest and lowest total new passengers.
•	Identifying the month with the highest revenue by city.
•	Repeat passenger rate analysis.
3. Data Visualization in Power BI
An interactive executive dashboard was built to provide quick insights. Key metrics visualized include:
  -	Trip volume trends.
  -	Revenue growth rate (%).
  -	Passenger segmentation (new vs. repeat).
  -	City-wise trip & revenue performance.
  -	Target vs. actual performance.
## Insights & Recommendations
- Key Findings:
  -	Jaipur leads in revenue (₹37M) with 77K trips, exceeding its 68K target. However, its repeat passenger rate is only 17%, indicating heavy dependence on new passengers for revenue growth.
  - Surat ranks in the top 3 in trips (54K) and has the highest repeat rate (43%). Its average fare per km is ₹11, the lowest among all cities, which correlates with lower revenue (₹6M). Additionally, its average passenger rating is 6.42, suggesting a need for service improvements.
  -	Mysore contributes 4% of total revenue, with an average fare per km of ₹15, which is higher than the city average of ₹13. Despite low repeat passenger rates (11%), Mysore exceeded its trip target by 9%, supported by strong passenger satisfaction (8.0+ ratings).
  -	Lucknow ranks second in trips (15%) and repeat rate. However, its revenue per trip is lower than the city average, and its poor passenger rating (6.49) may be impacting retention and overall revenue growth.
- Recommendations:
  -	Lucknow & Surat: Experience higher trip demand on weekdays. Adding shuttle services, optimizing fares, and improving passenger satisfaction can boost revenue and increase repeat passengers.
  -	Jaipur: Since it heavily depends on new passengers, implementing a loyalty programs such as subscription based programs or points based systems can help improve retention.
  -	Mysore: Lowering fare rates slightly or introducing promotional offers could help attract more repeat passengers.
